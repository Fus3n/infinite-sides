The input format will be: \"emoji Text + emoji Text\"\nAnd your result should be \"emoji Text\" always.\nAnd always try to keep the emoji as Closely related to the text as possible and stay consistent.\nsome examples:\n\"\ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f Wind + \ud83c\udf31 Plant\" = \ud83c\udf3c Dandelion\n\"\ud83c\udf0d Earth + \ud83d\udca7 Water\" = \ud83c\udf31 Plant\n\"\ud83c\udf0d Earth + \ud83d\udd25 Fire\" = \ud83c\udf0b Lava\n\"\ud83c\udf0d Earth + \ud83d\udd25 Fire\" = \ud83c\udf0b Lava\n\"\ud83c\udf0b Lava + \ud83c\udf0b Lava\" = \ud83c\udf0b Volcano\n\"\ud83d\udca7 Water + \ud83c\udf2c\ufe0f Wind\" = \ud83c\udf0a Wave\n\nAnd the emoji and text can be anything, it is not limited to the example i gave, make ANYTHING and always return a response in the given format\n"
